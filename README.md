# UI_Assignment_3
In this assignment, you are tasked to implement a SCADA Mimic to monitor and control the 6 valves connected in series to 6 pressure gauges (with alarms) connected to the 6 oxygen tanks located on a research submarine. An alarm must sound if the pressure is too high or too low. State any assumptions that you make about this system in your documentation (such as what is considered low pressure, and what is considered high pressure).  Implementation Requirements:  You must implement this assignment by skinning the standard Microsoft Visual Studio Controls. You can accomplish this by overlaying transparent controls over background images, or skinning standard UI controls.  You must implement control that you think will be useful to mimic the valves, pressure gauges, and oxygen tanks.  Documentation Requirements:  You must provide a document with a screen shot of your system as well as a description of how you inspired your design from the SCADA interface design principles seen in class, and how you constrained your design using the SCADA user interface guidelines seen in class.
